Upon click, the pop-up displays ___.



### File Descriptions
The assignment contains:
- an html file
- a "static" folder, which houses the css and javascript files. The "logic.js" file contains the majority of the work for the assignment. 
- an .ipynb file, which, for the sake of time, I created so that I could use the .describe function to determine some reasonable ranges for the depth, although ideally in the future, I would figure out how to do this in javascript.

### Resources
For this assignment, I received help from two BCS tutors, Reza and Khangwelo, to create the majority of the assignment. I then used ChatGPT to figure out that I should edit my CSS file so that the map legend displays properly, with the white padding and color swatches.
